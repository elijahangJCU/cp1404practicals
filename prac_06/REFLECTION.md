# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve started to slow down and plan better before I code. I now take the time to understand what each step is doing and test smaller parts before putting everything together. I’ve also learned how to use Git and PyCharm more confidently, which keeps my work more organised and less messy.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to work on my time management and stop waiting until the last minute to start my pracs. I’ve realised that spreading my work over a few days helps me understand more and feel less stressed. I also want to keep practising writing cleaner and more efficient code.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I’m doing well at staying consistent with my learning. I make sure I understand what each line of code does and not just copy it. I also try to ask questions when I’m stuck instead of sitting there guessing. I’ll definitely keep doing that.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating and getting distracted when I study. Sometimes I take too long on one thing trying to make it perfect instead of finishing the whole task. I’ll try to focus more on completing everything step-by-step first, then refine later.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think it would be great to have more quick video examples that show how each prac should flow from start to finish. Sometimes reading the instructions can feel a bit overwhelming, so seeing it in action first would really help.
