# CP1404 Practicals – Practical 07

## About This Repository
This repository contains my work for CP1404 Practical 07.  
I’m Elijah, a student learning about software design, object-oriented programming, and writing cleaner, more maintainable Python code.

## What I’ve Learned About Clean Code
- Write small, single-purpose functions that do one thing well.
- Use meaningful variable and function names to make code self-explanatory.
- Keep code consistent with proper indentation, spacing, and formatting.
- Use comments sparingly — clear code should mostly explain itself.
- Regularly refactor and test to ensure readability and maintainability.
